# Project Background

This is a project analyzing non-profit donations for an organization that serves the San Francisco Bay Area. The data contains records of donations made from June 2024 to June 2025 including data on donation dates, donation amounts, donor id, donor type, campaign id, fund allocation destination, records for recurring or annual donations. This project aims to use Excel, SQL, and Tableau to discover how donations are allocated, donation sources, investigating the effectiveness of different events in gathering donations. This project will also help identify the biggest donors in the system and identify seasonal patterns in donations to better understand donation patterns and increase future fundraising efforts during certain times like holidays or hosted events. 

Summary of Project:

### Caveats with the data
While the data contains a rich variety of information, there were several instances of data logging errors including misaligned dates, total donation calculations, duplicate columns, errors in records, and blank values, these issues were addressed using data cleaning methods through Excel. For example, date errors were cross-validated using the original dataset to reference the proper dates, duplicate columns were deleted, errors in records were addressed using a XLOOKUP function to reassign proper values. Blank values were left blank in instances where that data could not be filled in. Overall blank rows only affected a small portion of each column so most were left as is.
